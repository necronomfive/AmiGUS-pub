 * a) the AmiGUS Hardware does not allow BYTE access,
 * b) the BYTE access performance is just bad.
 * So per default, the buffer is LONGs for optimized access
 * and we have 0 to 3 additional BYTEs to copy in with performance impact.
 * As clients (HippoPlayer, AmigaAMP, ...) usually define the buffers in
 * kB or kiB, we are kind of safe to assume we only see LONGs as both are
 * dividable by 4. Therefore, 1-3 remaining BYTEs are handled only for the
 * end of the file and padded with the "end fill bytes" not causing any
